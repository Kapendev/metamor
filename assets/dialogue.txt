| A soft lamplight paints the room.
| The clock on the wall reads 11:32 PM.
| And I am staring intently.
| Staring at a strange pulsating egg.
| Nestled in my potted cactus.
| Did that cactus just lay an egg?
| That's... impossible.
| Right?

$ showBackground none

^ Yes. ^ No.

| Unless...
| Maybe it's a magic cactus?
| Like the one in that old book I read.

$ showBackground none

^ Yes. ^ No. ^ Maybe.

| Okay...
| Maybe a magic cactus is a stretch.
| But this is seriously weird.
| Maybe it's some kind of alien egg?
| Like from those sci-fi movies.

$ showBackground none

^ Yes. ^ Maybe.

$ showBackground room

> chloe
| Hmm...
| ...
| I want to poke it.
| What's the worst that could happen?
| A tiny cactus monster pops out?

$ showBackground none

^ Please no. ^ Please no. ^ Please no. ^ Please no.

| Nah, that's probably not it.
| But still... maybe I shouldn't.
| Maybe I should leave it alone.
| See if it hatches on its own.
| Then I can be all scientific about it.
| Like on those nature documentaries.
| "And here we see..."
| "The rare cactus creature."
| "In its natural habitat... my bedroom."
| ...
| This is why I shouldn't eat so much candy.
| My brain is officially fried.
| Maybe I should just... sleep on it.
| Literally.

| Don't hatch while I'm asleep, okay?
| That would be super creepy.

^ Poke the egg. ^ Leave it alone.

    | Behold!
    | The magnificent Chef Frogger!
    | Hatched at your command!
    | Prepare to be amazed by my culinary!
    | ...
    | Wait a minute...
    | This isn't a kitchen.
    > chloe
    | But it's an egg...
    > frog
    | Right.
    | Tiny technical difficulty.
    | I haven't quite mastered metamorphosis.
    > chloe
    | Metamor... what?
    > frog
    | You know, caterpillar to butterfly...
    | Except... well, not quite.
    | Perhaps I'm a frogbutterfly?
    | A flyfrog?
    > chloe
    | A flyfrog!
    > frog
    | Indeed!
    | Now.
    | Where can I find some delicious flies?
    > chloe
    | There aren't any flies here...
    > frog
    | No flies?!
    | This is a culinary catastrophe!
    > chloe
    | Don't worry.
    | I have some gummy worms.
    > frog
    | Hmm... Unconventional.
    | But beggars can't be choosers.

    $ showBackground room

    > frog
    | Mm...
    | These are delightful!
    > chloe
    | See? Everything worked out!
    > frog
    | Yes, but...
    | My culinary talents are wasted...
    | ...

    | *A moment of silence*

    $ showBackground room

    > frog
    | Hmm...
    | But a true chef adapts!
    | Perhaps I can whip up a gourmet...
    | Cactus salad?
    > chloe
    | I don't think cacti are edible...
    > frog
    | Nonsense!
    | Everything can be a delicacy!

    $ showBackground room

    > frog
    | ...
    | Okay, maybe not everything.
    > chloe
    | Maybe you shouldn't experiment on my plants...
    > frog
    | Perhaps a career change is in order.
    | How about a singing frog?
    > chloe
    | You can sing?
    > frog
    | Behold!
    > chloe
    | Maybe stick with the culinary arts.

    | *Later that night*
    | *The flyfrog is happily munching on gummy worms*

    $ showBackground room

    > frog
    | Mm...
    | This simple life isn't so bad after all.
    | ...
    | Perhaps true metamorphosis...
    | Isn't about becoming something else.
    | But appreciating the things around you.

    | You can talk?

    > bee
    | Well...
    | I haven't quite figured it out yet.
    | The whole "aerodynamics" thing.
    | It's a bouncing situation.
    > chloe
    | A bouncing bee!
    > bee
    | Exactly!
    | The first of its kind!
    > chloe
    | Do you need help getting around?
    > bee
    | That would be fantastic!
    | But be careful.
    | I'm still a little... ticklish.
    > chloe
    | Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
    | Now, where do you want to go?
    | To a flower patch?
    | I don't know if I can do that now.
    > bee
    | No flowers?!
    | What a disaster!
    > chloe
    | I have some sugar water.
    | How about that?
    > bee
    | Sugar water?
    | BZZZ!

    | See? Everything worked out!
    > bee
    | Almost everything...
    | This bouncing is exhausting!
    | I feel like a ping-pong ball!
    > chloe
    | Maybe you can be a... ground bee?
    > bee
    | A ground bee?
    | Sounds... unimpressive.
    > chloe
    | But think about it!
    | You can explore things on the ground!
    | Like ants and... uh... pebbles?
    > bee
    | Pebbles?
    | I suppose...
    | It's better than bouncing aimlessly.

    | See? Even without wings...
    | You can still be a fantastic bee.
    > bee
    | You know...
    | Maybe being different isn't so bad.
    | Maybe it's what makes us... well, us.
    > chloe
    | And maybe sometimes...
    | The most beautiful transformations...
    | Are the ones we never expected.
