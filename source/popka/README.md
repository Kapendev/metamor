# üçÇ Popka

Popka is a lightweight and beginner-friendly 2D game engine for the D programming language.
It focuses on providing a simple and easy-to-understand foundation for building 2D games.
The game engine is currently under development and is not yet ready for use.

```d
/// A hello-world example.

import popka.basic;

void main() {
    openWindow(640, 480);
    lockResolution(320, 180);
    while (isWindowOpen) {
        drawDebugText("Hello world!");
    }
    freeWindow();
}
```
